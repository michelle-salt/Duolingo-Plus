# Duolingo Plus - Hackapalooza 2021
A chrome extension that changes the language of every website you go on to a different language.
N.B. All http and https websites get translated except for the following search engines: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo!, Baidu, and Yandex.

Currently, this extension can only translate English into Dutch, Greek, Arabic, and Japanese.
Immerse yourself in a different language by changing the language of any (and all) websites you visit to a random language.
