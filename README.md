# Duolingo Plus
A chrome extension that changes the language of every website you go on to a different language.
N.B. All http and https websites get translated except for the following search engines: Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo!, Baidu, and Yandex.

Currently, this extension can only translate English into Dutch, Greek, Arabic, and Japanese.
Immerse yourself in a different language by changing the language of any (and all) websites you visit to a random language.

## How to Install

## Resources Used
For help changing the text of a webpage, I utilized the code of [a pre-existing repo](https://github.com/XilkyTofu/bilibili_translate_chrome_extension)

A list of English words was extracted from [MIT's website](https://www.mit.edu/~ecprice/wordlist.10000) and translated using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.ca/?sl=auto&tl=en&op=translate)
